        <h2> Womens Record</h2>
        <p> The womens team has been showered in success since the first world cup in 1991. They won the coveted World Cup in 1991,1999,2015, and 2019. They also have celebrated Gold in 4 of the 6 Olympics they have participated in: 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012. Finally they have continuously dominated North American competition winning the CONCACAF 9 times: 1991, 1993, 1994, 2000, 2002, 2006, 2014, and 2018. </p>

        <h2> Mens Record</h2>
        <p> The Mens team unfortunately has not shared the surplus of success like the women. The men have never won a world cup in their 10 appearences, with their first appearence in 1930 being their best result of 3rd. They also have never won an Olympic Gold in their 11 appearences. The senior team have not compete since in the Olympics since 1992. In their 11 appearences, again their first appearence in 1904 was their best result, 2nd. However the boys in red, white, and blue have had great success in thee CONCACAF tournament on their home turf. With 6 championships-1991,2002,2005,2007,2013,2017- it has beeen by far their most successful tournament.</p>
