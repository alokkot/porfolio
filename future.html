<img src="images/gio.jpg" alt="Gio Reyna" width="302" height="302" id="pic1">
  <p>Gio Reyna is a 17 year old American prospect from New York. He spent majority of his youth career with NYCFC Academy, and made the jump to professional European soccer&nbsp; in January 2020 to Borrusia Dortmund. He has already made 22 appearences in Germany and is an exciting prospect to rotate in the USA attack. Many expect him to become not just an American Star but world talent.</p>

<div class= 'container1'>
  <img src="images/ty.png" alt="Tyler Addams" id="pic2">
<p>Tyler Addams is another young talent on the Mens side also orginally from New York and now playing professional soccer in Germany.Tyler is 21 years old and began his career on the NYRB Academy and continued up to the first team. His pace and skill did not takw long to get noticed as he was quickly picked up by RB Leipzig, another top side in Germany. Addams has already reached 10 caps for the Senior National Team and has over 30 caps for the U-17 and U-20 team.</p>

<div class= 'container2'>
  <img src="images/Alcook.jpg" alt="Alana Cook" id="pic3">
<p>Cook didn't enter the most recent NWSL draft and instead signed with PSG in France. So the same weekend NWSL rookies debuted, she started in a loss against juggernaut Lyon. That is its own kind of learning curve. Cook often looked poised beyond her years at Stanford and comes across as a natural leader (she captained the U.S. U-23 team this spring).</p>

<div class= 'container3'>
  <img src="images/Lhoran .png" alt="Lindesey Horan" id="pic4">
<p>At 24 Lindsey Horan is already the reigning NWSL League MVP. She is widely ackwoledged as one of the most complete players in the game, as the perfect hybrid of speed, power, and class. So far for the National team she has recorded 5 goals and 9 assists as a box to box midfielder, and many believe she has not even scratched the surface for what she can accomplish at the national level.</p>
